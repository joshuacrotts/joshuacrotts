<h2 style="bold;" align="center">Hello, and welcome to my repo! üëã</h2>

üñ•Ô∏è I have had a fondness for technology and computers since I was around two years old. I would watch my dad use the computer, and in time, I was in his shoes. While he wasn't a computer scientist, my daily usage of computers and eventual plunge into the curiosity of how a computer works led me to major in computer science at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. I am working on my master's at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, and will begin my PhD in Fall 2022 at Indiana University. Go Hoosiers!

üìë I currently research topics in artificial intelligence with a focus on rhetoric, education, and Prolog with [Dr. Nancy L. Green](https://www.uncg.edu/cmp/faculty/nlgreen/). I have three published papers in [inductive logic programming](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2937/paper7.pdf), [antithesis detection](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2669/paper9.pdf), and [AI argument scheme education](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2669/paper5.pdf). I also plan to do more independent research. I have also presented at the [14th](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wS_aVPmFHoU) and [15th](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wS_aVPmFHoU) Thomas Undergraduate Creativity Expo as well as the [21st Annual Honors Undergraduate Symposium](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuEuSlaCLjk) at UNCG. I recently presented a [nifty assignment](http://nifty.stanford.edu/2022/crotts-matzureff-ray-marching/) at [SIGCSE 2022](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3478432.3499268). My master's thesis will focus on improving the pedagogy of natural deduction proofs and logical thought processing.

üéì I am a graduate teaching assistant for five classes in Spring 2022: one section of operating systems, one section of algorithms, one section of senior capstone, one section of system programming, and one section of database system principles. Previously, I have TA'd for system programming, senior capstone, database system principles, as well as several sections of our local introduction to computer science course for two years. Additionally, I held review sessions/recitations for our philosophy department's introduction to formal logic course for two semesters. I am also an academic tutor at [Pearson](https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/products-services-institutions/smarthinking/administrators.html).
 
üéÆ Other relevant interests are high-performance and parallel computing/processing, embedded software engineering, compiler design, low-level programming (e.g. systems programming), operating systems, and video game design (hence why my major projects are either games or game engines in C and Java!). Check out my repository to see some of these projects-most contain a detailed README with a .gif demo-ing the code.

üìì My theoretical computer science interests are in formal (prepositional/predicate/modal) logic, higher-order logic, programming language design and implementation, computer science education, compiler design, theory of computation, algorithm analysis, computer graphics, artificial intelligence, and natural language processing. It's all over the place, but that's what I like!
