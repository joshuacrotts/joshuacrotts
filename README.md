<h2 style="bold;" align="center">Hello, and welcome to my repo! 👋</h2>

🖥️ I have had a fondness for technology and computers since I was around two years old. I would watch my dad use the computer, and in time, I was in his shoes. While he wasn't a computer scientist, my daily usage of computers and eventual plunge into the curiosity of how a computer works led me to major in computer science at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. Go Spartans!

📑 I currently research topics in artificial intelligence with a focus on rhetoric, education, and Prolog with [Dr. Nancy L. Green](https://www.uncg.edu/cmp/faculty/nlgreen/). I have three published papers in inductive logic programming, rhetorical device detection, and AI argument scheme education. One paper is currently under review, and I plan to do more independent research. I have also presented at the (14th and 15th) Thomas Undergraduate Creativity Expo as well as the 21st Annual Honors Undergraduate Symposium at UNCG. My master's thesis will focus on improving the pedagogy of natural deduction proofs and logical thought processing.

🎓 In addition to the rhetorical, artificial intelligence-based work, I also have a fondness for computer science education. Right now, I am working on my master's and will pursue a PhD with the goals of becoming a research professor. I am a graduate teaching assistant for three classes in Fall 2020: two sections of system programming, and one section of database systems.

🎮 Other relevant interests are high-performance and parallel computing/processing, embedded software engineering, compiler design, low-level programming (e.g. systems programming), operating systems, and video game design (hence why my major projects are either games or game engines in C and Java!). 

📓 My theoretical computer science interests are in formal (prepositional/predicate/modal) logic, higher-order logic, programming language design and implementation, computer science education, compiler design, theory of computation, algorithm analysis, computer graphics, artificial intelligence, and natural language processing. It's all over the place, but that's what I like!
