<h2 style="bold;" align="center">Hello, and welcome to my repo! üëã</h2>

üñ•Ô∏è I have had a fondness for technology and computers since I was around two years old. I would watch my dad use the computer, and in time, I was in his shoes. While he wasn't a computer scientist, my daily usage of computers and eventual plunge into the curiosity of how a computer works led me to major in computer science at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. I earned my bachelor's and master's in computer science at UNCG, and will begin my PhD in the Fall 2022 semester at Indiana University. Go Hoosiers!

üìë I currently research topics in artificial intelligence with a focus on rhetoric, education, and Prolog with [Dr. Nancy L. Green](https://www.uncg.edu/cmp/faculty/nlgreen/). I have three published papers in [inductive logic programming](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2937/paper7.pdf), [antithesis detection](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2669/paper9.pdf), and [AI argument scheme education](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2669/paper5.pdf). I also plan to do more independent research. I have also presented at the [14th](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wS_aVPmFHoU) and [15th](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wS_aVPmFHoU) Thomas Undergraduate Creativity Expo as well as the [21st Annual Honors Undergraduate Symposium](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuEuSlaCLjk) at UNCG. I recently presented a [nifty assignment](http://nifty.stanford.edu/2022/crotts-matzureff-ray-marching/) at [SIGCSE 2022](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3478432.3499268). My master's thesis will focus on improving the pedagogy of natural deduction proofs and logical thought processing.

üéì As a UNCG master's student, I TA'd for system programming, operating systems, algorithm analysis and design, database system principles, senior capstone, as well as several sections of UNCG's introduction to computer science course for two years. Additionally, I held review sessions/recitations for UNCG's philosophy department's introduction to formal logic course for two semesters. I am also an academic tutor at [Pearson](https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/products-services-institutions/smarthinking/administrators.html).
 
üéÆ Other relevant interests are high-performance and parallel computing/processing, embedded software engineering, compiler design, low-level programming (e.g. systems programming), operating systems, and video game design (hence why my major projects are either games or game engines in C and Java!). Check out my repository to see some of these projects-most contain a detailed README with a .gif demo-ing the code.

üìì My theoretical computer science interests include programming language theory, formal (prepositional/predicate/modal) logic, higher-order logics, computer science education, compiler design, theory of computation, algorithm analysis, computer graphics, artificial intelligence, and natural language processing. It's all over the place, but that's what I like!
